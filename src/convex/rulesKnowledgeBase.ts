// VERSIONED LEGAL METROLOGY (PACKAGED COMMODITIES) RULES KNOWLEDGE BASE
// ============================================================================
// Source of truth: Department of Consumer Affairs (Ministry of Consumer
// Affairs, Food and Public Distribution) publications — the Principal Rules,
// 2011 (G.S.R. 640(E), dated 07.03.2011) and the amending notifications as
// published on consumeraffairs.gov.in / the e-Gazette:
//
//   • LM (PC) Rules, 2011 (Principal)              G.S.R. 640(E)  07.03.2011
//   • LM (PC) Amendment Rules, 2014 (importer
//     declarations consolidated into Rule 6)
//   • LM (PC) Amendment Rules, 2017 (e-commerce)   G.S.R. 629(E)  23.06.2017
//     → Rule 6(10) e-listing declarations, Rule 9(6); w.e.f. 01.01.2018
//   • LM (PC) Amendment Rules, 2021                G.S.R. 779(E)  02.11.2021
//     → unit sale price (Rule 6(1)(f)), ₹ symbol for MRP, single date basis
//       (month & year of manufacture only), consumer-care telephone + e-mail;
//       w.e.f. 01.04.2022
//   • LM (PC) Amendment Rules, 2022 (computation)  notified 28.03.2022
//     → unit sale price computation clarified; Second Schedule (standard
//       pack sizes) omitted; USP in force w.e.f. 01.10.2022
//   • LM (PC) Second Amendment Rules, 2025         G.S.R. 881(E)  02.12.2025
//     → Rule 26(a) proviso: pan masala exempt; w.e.f. 01.02.2026
//   • LM (PC) Amendment Rules, 2026                G.S.R. 128(E)  13.02.2026
//     → Rule 6(10A) country-of-origin filter on e-commerce; w.e.f. 01.07.2026
//   • LM (PC) Second Amendment Rules, 2026         notified 27.04.2026
//     → substitutes Rule 6(10A); w.e.f. 01.07.2027
//
// GUIDING PRINCIPLES (enforced by the engine, not by this file):
//   1. Nothing is invented at runtime. Every requirement cites a rule number,
//      the amendment that last changed it, and that amendment's effective date.
//   2. The AI first determines WHICH requirements apply (category, origin,
//      channel, package context), then checks each applicable one.
//   3. Failure to READ a declaration is never a FAIL — it is REVIEW.
//      FAIL is reserved for values that WERE read and are clearly non-compliant.
//   4. Exceptions/exemptions (Rule 26 etc.) are first-class records; an exempt
//      requirement is not a violation.
//
// SUB-RULE NUMBERING NOTE: letters of Rule 6(1) follow the current
// consolidated DCA text — (a) name/address, (b) country of origin (inserted
// with the 2014 importer consolidation), (c) common name, (d) net quantity,
// (e) retail sale price (MRP), (f) unit sale price (2021), (g) month & year,
// (h) best before/use by, (i) consumer care. MRP at 6(1)(e) is corroborated by
// Pepsico India Holdings v. State of Kerala (2022). Where a letter could not be
// independently verified from a primary source, the citation is written at
// clause level ("Rule 6(1) — <requirement>") rather than inventing a letter.
